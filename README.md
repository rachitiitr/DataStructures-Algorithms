# Repository Road Map
1. In many job interviews you will be asked to solve a series of problems related to coding. The [coding interview](/Famous-Coding-Interview-Problems) folder gives a list of some popular problems and solutions in C++.
  - The goal in [Jump Game 2](/Famous-Coding-Interview-Problems/JumpGame2.cpp) is to find a minimum steps along an array from one index to another.
  - Interviewers may also ask you to demonstrate many concepts of [Object Oriented Programing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), we can do this in [one program](/Famous-Coding-Interview-Problems/OopsAllConcepts.cpp).
  - The [Coin Change Problem](/Famous-Coding-Interview-Problems/TheCoinChangeProblem.cpp) is often used to demonstrate the applicants understanding of [Dynamic Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming). In this challenge you are given specified coin values and a final value, you must return the number of combinations you can use to get the final value.
  - In the [first Duplicate Xor Problem](/Famous-Coding-Interview-Problems/TheDuplicateXorArrayProblem-I.cpp) you are given an array of duplicates a and must remove the duplicate of a given value x.
  - In the [second Duplicate Xor Problem](/Famous-Coding-Interview-Problems/TheDuplicateXorArrayProblem-II.cpp) you are given an array of duplicates and must remove the duplicates of two values x and y.
  - The [Recursive Stack Problem](/Famous-Coding-Interview-Problems/TheRecursiveStackProblem.cpp) tests your knowledge of [recursion](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-recursion-data-structure-and-algorithm-tutorials/). You are given a string of balanced parenthesis (meaning for every "(" there is a ")") and you are asked to find the final "score" where: "A = ()" => 1, "(A)" = 2\*A, and "AB" = A+B.
  - In the [Splitwise Problem](/Famous-Coding-Interview-Problems/TheSplitwiseProblem.cpp) you are given a group of people and each of these people make transactions, you need need to find the minimum number of transactions that will settle all of the debts.
2.[Leet Code](https://leetcode.com/) is a popular web platform to practice coding and prepare for interviews, the [Leet Code folder](/LeetCode) provides solutions to many problems if you are struggling
  - It is recommended that you try these problems on your own before looking for solutions
3. The [Library](Library) provides tutorials for various concepts in Data Structures
  - [DP](/DP) provides examples of dynamic programming
  - [DS](/DS) Provides examples of algorithms working on different types of data structures
  - [Graph](/Graph) provides examples of algorithms in [Graph Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory)
  - [Math](/Math) provides examples of generic mathematical algorithms
  - [Miscellanious](/Miscellanious) provides useful generic algorithms
  - [Tree](/Tree) provides examples of algorithms that work with [tree data structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure))
  - [Galt](/Galt) contains algorithms for sparse tables
4. [Tricks](/Tricks) contains quick solutions to problems that help you move a lot faster
